## 🌟 Project Overview

**SpecVision** is a novel, open-source framework developed by the LMSC Lab at EPFL. It is dedicated to **advancing the field of computational spectroscopy** by providing high-performance tools for the analysis, visualization, and interpretation of spectral data (e.g., hyperspectral images, Raman, FTIR).

* **Key Features:**
    * **High-performance Data Processing:** Optimized routines for large-scale spectral data manipulation.
    * **Novel Spectral Algorithms:** Includes advanced algorithms for spectral unmixing, denoising, and component identification.
    * **Machine Learning Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with deep learning models specifically tuned for spectral vision tasks.
