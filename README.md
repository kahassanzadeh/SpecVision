## 🌟 Project Overview

**SpecVision** is a novel, open-source framework developed by the LMSC Lab at EPFL. It is dedicated to **advancing the field of computational spectroscopy** by providing high-performance tools for the analysis, visualization, and interpretation of spectral data (e.g., hyperspectral images, Raman, FTIR).

* **Key Features:**
    * **High-performance Data Processing:** Optimized routines for large-scale spectral data manipulation.
    * **Novel Spectral Algorithms:** Includes advanced algorithms for spectral unmixing, denoising, and component identification.
    * **Machine Learning Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with deep learning models specifically tuned for spectral vision tasks.

**Important Notes for Implementation:**

1.  **Image Path:** I used `![SpecVision Logo](image_0ca71a.png)` at the top. You must ensure the logo file (`image_0ca71a.png`) is in the **same directory** as the `README.md` file, or update the path accordingly.
2.  **Placeholders:** Remember to replace the bracketed placeholders (`[Short, compelling subtitle]`, `[Your Main Algorithm Name]`, `[Your License Type]`, and all citation/link details) with your project's specific information.

Let me know if you'd like to refine any of the descriptions before you commit this file!
